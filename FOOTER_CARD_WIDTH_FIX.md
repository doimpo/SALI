# Footer Contact Card Width Fix

**Fixed**: White contact card width and overflow issues  
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The white contact card in the footer (with "Quick Contacts" heading) was too wide and overlapping content, causing layout issues across different screen sizes.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Footer Component (`src/components/Footer.astro`)

**Changed column width from `col-lg-4` to `col-lg-3`:**
```astro
<!-- Before -->
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">

<!-- After -->
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">
```

This reduces the card width from 4/12 columns (33.33%) to 3/12 columns (25%) on large screens.

### 2. Footer CSS (`src/styles/module/_footer.scss`)

#### Added width constraints to contact card:
```scss
.footer-widget-contact {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 40px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    background-color: $color-white;
    max-width: 100%;        // ✅ Added
    width: 100%;           // ✅ Added
    box-sizing: border-box; // ✅ Added
}
```

#### Enhanced text wrapping for contact list items:
```scss
.contact-list li {
    line-height: 26px;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    word-wrap: break-word;      // ✅ Added
    overflow-wrap: break-word;  // ✅ Added
    hyphens: auto;             // ✅ Added
}
```

#### Fixed phone number and email overflow:
```scss
.phone__number {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: $font-heading;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 22px;
    line-height: 1;
    color: #3851a2 !important;
    word-break: break-all;     // ✅ Added

    // ... rest of styles
}

.email__address {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    word-break: break-all;      // ✅ Added
    overflow-wrap: break-word;  // ✅ Added
}
```

#### Enhanced mobile responsiveness:
```scss
/* Mobile Phones */
@include xs-sm-screens {
    .footer-widget-contact {
        margin: 10px 0;        // ✅ Added
        padding: 15px;         // ✅ Reduced from 20px
    }

    .phone__number {
        font-size: 18px;       // ✅ Reduced from 22px
        margin: 10px 0;        // ✅ Reduced
    }

    .contact-list li {
        font-size: 13px;       // ✅ Added
        line-height: 22px;     // ✅ Reduced from 26px
    }
}
```

#### Added responsive constraints for tablets:
```scss
@media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
    .footer-widget-contact {
        padding: 20px;
        max-width: 100%;       // ✅ Added
        margin: 0 auto;        // ✅ Added
    }
}
```
