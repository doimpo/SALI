**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The white contact card in the footer (with "Quick Contacts" heading) was too narrow and needed to be increased to better match the visual prominence shown in the design reference.

## ✅ Changes Made

### Footer Component (`src/components/Footer.astro`)

#### Increased contact card width from `col-lg-3` to `col-lg-5`:
```astro
<!-- Before -->
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">

<!-- After -->
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5">
```

This increases the card width from 3/12 columns (25%) to 5/12 columns (41.67%) on large screens.

#### Removed offset from Services column:
```astro
<!-- Before -->
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-2 offset-lg-1">

<!-- After -->
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-2">
```

This creates better balance by removing the unnecessary offset.
