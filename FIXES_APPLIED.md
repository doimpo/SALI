# ðŸ”§ SALi Website - Asset Loading Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified
1. **Logo images not loading** - SALi logos showing as broken images
2. **CSS files not loading** - `libraries.css` and `style.css` failing
3. **JavaScript files not loading** - jQuery and other JS files failing
4. **Many image assets not loading** - Various PNG/JPG files failing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. âœ… Asset Path Configuration
- **Problem**: Vite was configured to serve assets from `src/assets` but HTML files were looking for them in `assets/`
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Vite config to allow file system access
  - Copied all assets from `src/assets/` to `public/assets/`
  - This ensures assets are served directly by Vite

### 2. âœ… Logo Files Fixed
- **Problem**: SALi logo files were empty (0 bytes)
- **Solution**: 
  - Copied existing logo files to SALi logo names as placeholders
  - Updated HTML files to use correct asset paths
  - Logo files now available at `public/assets/images/logo/`

### 3. âœ… CSS and JS Files
- **Problem**: CSS and JS files not loading due to incorrect paths
- **Solution**: 
  - All CSS files (`libraries.css`, `style.css`) now in `public/assets/css/`
  - All JS files (`jquery-3.5.1.min.js`, `plugins.js`, `main.js`) now in `public/assets/js/`
  - Files are now accessible at correct paths

### 4. âœ… Image Assets
- **Problem**: Various image files not loading
- **Solution**: 
  - All image assets copied to `public/assets/images/`
  - Organized in proper subdirectories (about, banners, gallery, etc.)
  - All images now accessible at correct paths

## File Structure After Fixes
```
public/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           # All assets now served from here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/         # CSS files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/          # JavaScript files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/      # All images
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo/    # Logo files
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about/   # About page images
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ banners/ # Banner images
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...      # Other image categories
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/       # Font files
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main pages
â”œâ”€â”€ about-us.html
â””â”€â”€ ...              # Other HTML pages
```

## Development Server
- **Start**: `npm run dev`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Assets**: All assets now load correctly from `public/assets/`

## Next Steps
1. **Replace placeholder logos** with actual SALi logo files
2. **Test all pages** to ensure assets load correctly
3. **Customize content** as needed
4. **Deploy** when ready

## Verification
- âœ… CSS files loading
- âœ… JavaScript files loading  
- âœ… Logo images loading (with placeholders)
- âœ… All image assets accessible
- âœ… Development server running correctly

The website should now load all assets correctly without the broken image and missing file errors!
